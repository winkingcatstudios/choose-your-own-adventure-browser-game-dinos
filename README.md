# choose-your-own-adventure-browser-game-dinos
A choose your own adventure game with mechanics based on the Dungeons and Dragons Standard Reference Document (SRD) published under the Open Gaming License (OGL). During the module, players encounter an anthropomorphic dinosaur who communicates by producing scents based on its emotions. The players can defeat the pirate antagonists without the help of the dinosaur, but their chances are slim. The key to success is to learn how to communicate with the dinosaur through its unorthodox emotional language.
